# About the project

This project is a scouting and monitoring tool designed to assist the youth department of Hapoel Jerusalem Football Club in identifying potential player prospects.
The tool scrapes data from the Israeli Football Association website, processes youth team player statistics, and automatically generates a professional report highlighting players that meet specific criteria.
